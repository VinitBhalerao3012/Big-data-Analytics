# Exploratory Data Analysis and Big Data Strategy

This project is a two-part academic report exploring data analysis and big data handling using R and scalable technologies.

## 📊 Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis with R

Conducted detailed analysis on a car price dataset using R and the tidyverse package. The process involved:

- Data importing and cleaning
- Handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates
- Data transformation and summarization with dplyr
- Visualization using ggplot2 (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, density plots)
- Summary statistics (mean, median, IQR, etc.)

## 🧠 Part 2: Big Data Architecture and Strategy

Discussed challenges and solutions for analyzing large datasets (Big Data), including:

- Data storage and distributed systems (HDFS, Amazon S3)
- Processing frameworks (Apache Spark with R integration via sparklyr)
- Comparison of OLAP vs OLTP systems
- Cloud vs On-premises solutions
- Proposal for a scalable architecture using NoSQL, distributed systems, and R integration

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- R & RStudio
- tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, sparklyr
- Apache Spark
- Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google BigQuery)
- Docker (for containerized R environments)

## 📌 Key Outcomes

- Built a clean and interpretable analysis pipeline in R
- Designed a modern big data analytics architecture
- Compared traditional and cloud-based analytical approaches
